## ARCH-SETUP

WARNING: This is not ready for use. No not attempt to run.  

This is a simple script that I created to set up and configure a fresh Arch installation. I was inspired by Omarchy but wanted to have a more simple and less opinionated install script. Feel free to customize this to your own preferences!
